      <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Hello, I'm Maryâ€”a full-stack developer with a unique educational background. <br>I earned my bachelor's degree in Psychology from the University of California, Merced. While my formal education was centered around psychology, I discovered a passion for coding over a year and a half ago and have been deeply involved in it ever since. When I'm not immersed in coding, you can find me staying active through workouts and boxing, exploring new destinations, indulging in diverse cuisines, or simply enjoying music. These personal interests not only keep me balanced but continuously fuel my creativity and drive in the tech world.</p>
